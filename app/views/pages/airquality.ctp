<h1>Air Quality Fact Sheet</h1>
<p style="color: #5cb3ff;"><em>"Teck Trail Operations has made many environmental improvements that have helped the Trail Area Health and Environment Committee meet, and in some cases exceed, its air quality goals. &nbsp;We are committed to continuing to improve our environmental performance and align with provincial, national and global best practices for the health of our local community.&rdquo;&nbsp; Richard Deane, Teck&rsquo;s Manager of Environment, Health and Safety.<br /></em></p>
<h2>What is the Air Quality Program?</h2>
<p>The Air Quality Program includes stack and dust emissions reductions from Teck Trail Operations, dust control in the community, ongoing monitoring of air quality and reporting on air conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stack emissions of lead and other metals have been reduced by over 99% since the 1990s, and health risks from air quality today are considered to be very low. New goals were set through public consultation in 2010 to aim for further improvements in air quality. Teck has recently started a specific program to reduce &ldquo;fugitive&rdquo; dust emissions at the Teck Trail Operations site, which is now recognized as the greatest opportunity to further reduce emissions.&nbsp; Please read on for more information.<br /><br /><strong>Why is the Air Quality Program important?</strong><br />The aim of THE Program is to prevent children&rsquo;s exposure to lead and reduce children&rsquo;s blood lead levels on a continuous improvement basis. Although young children are mainly exposed to lead through hand-to-mouth activity rather than breathing, much of the lead in dust where they live and play comes from ongoing smelter emissions. Emissions reduction makes the biggest contribution to improving air quality and reducing people&rsquo;s exposure to lead in the community.<br /><br /><strong>How is air quality in the Trail area today? </strong><br />Currently, air quality meets all applicable regulatory standards for air pollutants such as lead and arsenic, sulphur dioxide, and particulates (smoke or dust) in the air.   The main health risks relate to emissions of lead; the risks posed by other smelter-related metals are low.&nbsp; Arsenic in community air is second in importance.&nbsp; <br /><br />  Air quality fluctuates with weather conditions including wind strength and direction as well as temperature inversions during high pressure systems. During temperature inversions, there may be occasional sulphur odours and a slight haze. People with respiratory conditions such as asthma may notice a slight irritation at those times. These situations are addressed immediately by Teck and typically don&rsquo;t last long.  Teck monitors air quality continuously and, as needed, takes all necessary steps to maintain air quality. &nbsp;Residents who have concerns about air quality are encouraged to call Teck Environmental Issues at (250) 364-4817, a phone line answered 24 hours a day.<br />&nbsp;<br />Over the last few years, &ldquo;ambient&rdquo; lead (lead in air) concentrations have averaged on the order of 0.35 &micro;g/m<sup>3</sup> (micrograms per cubic meter of air) and ambient arsenic concentrations are now around 0.015 &micro;g/m<sup>3</sup>. The goal of the THEC is for continuous improvement of these levels.<strong><br /><br /><img src="/upload/images/Lead_in_Community_Air.jpg" alt="" /></strong></p>
<p><strong><br /><img src="/upload/images/Arsenic_in_community_Air.jpg" alt="" /><br /><br />What are the air quality goals?  </strong><br />We are always aiming to improve air quality and the public supports our air quality goals.&nbsp; In 2010, following public consultation, the Trail Area Health &amp; Environment Committee set new goals for lead and arsenic in the air. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>The goals are:</em></span><br /> &bull; To achieve a level lead in community air of 0.20 &micro;g/m<sup>3</sup> or lower by 2018. <br />&bull; To achieve a level arsenic in community air of 0.01 &micro;g/m<sup>3</sup> or lower by 2018.<br /><br />  With these goals, the THEC aims to meet the leading air quality standards in Canada. <br />BC&rsquo;s air quality objectives have not been revised since 1979, while other provinces have recently set lower standards based on new scientific knowledge. For lead, Ontario set a new standard of 0.20 &micro;g/m<sup>3</sup> (micrograms per cubic metre of air) in 2008. For arsenic, Alberta set a new objective of 0.01 &micro;g/m<sup>3</sup> in 2005. In each province, multi-year timeframes were specified for achieving the new requirements.<strong><br /><br />What has been achieved with air quality?</strong><br /><br /><img src="/upload/images/Lead_emissions_for_stacks1.jpg" alt="" /><br /><br />Air quality has continued to improve through plant modernization and operational improvements at Teck Trail Operations.&nbsp; Air quality has improved significantly since the KIVCET lead smelter was installed in 1997.&nbsp; Emissions of lead and other metals from the smelter stacks have been reduced by over 99% since the 1990s.&nbsp; <a title="family health fact sheet" href="/pages/familyhealth" target="_blank">Children&rsquo;s blood lead levels have decreased</a> significantly over the same time period.<strong><br /><br /><img src="/upload/images/Arsenic_from_Stacks.jpg" alt="" /><br /><br />What is Teck doing to reduce emissions?  </strong><br />Emissions reduction includes identifying the main sources of lead and arsenic emissions from the site, and improving emissions through equipment modernization, enhanced operational processes, and improving maintenance in key areas.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Teck has a new initiative to reduce &ldquo;fugitive emissions&rdquo;.&nbsp; Fugitive dust is dust that escapes from buildings, stockpiles, roadways, and other activities on site.&nbsp; Data shows that fugitive dust is now the greatest opportunity to further reduce emissions. &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Current priorities for emissions reduction   </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Teck has a focused program to reduce fugitive dust at the Teck Trail Operations site. The program will focus on reducing dust:</p>
<ul>
<li>From open mixing and storage of concentrate and process materials</li>
<li>From transportation of materials around the site</li>
<li>That escapes from operating buildings<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p>As part of this project, Teck is constructing a storage building at the north end of the site, and studying the feasibility of two other large storage buildings that would enclose mixing activities and provide for indoor short term storage of process materials.&nbsp; Improvements to materials handling and movement are also being examined. This program is a comprehensive multi-year effort to identify and reduce fugitive dust emissions at Teck Trail Operations. Data show that fugitive dust is now the main opportunity for further emissions reduction. &nbsp;Click <a title="Fugitive Dust Update June 2013" href="/upload/resources/67/Teck_Fugitive_Dust_Project_Update_June_2013_original.pdf">here</a> to read Teck's June 2013 update on the Fugitive Dust Project.<br /><br />Teck has also purchased two street sweepers to improve its ability to collect and recycle dust that builds up on roads inside Trail Operations when materials are being transported.<br /><br />Teck has set goals for internal management and improvement of the pollution control equipment (known as bag-houses) that removes particulate from the air. This involves establishing a consistent management system for operation, maintenance and monitoring, as well as auditing processes to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Teck is researching and will implement feasible solutions for reducing arsenic sources.<br />A second real-time monitor for metal levels in air is being purchased to further enhance emissions monitoring. <br /><br /><strong>How is air quality monitored?</strong><br />Teck monitors air quality in the community in several ways: <br />Measures of lead, arsenic and other particles in the air are taken at two testing locations in Greater Trail: Butler Park and Birchbank. Readings are taken over 24 hour periods. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Dustfall measurements are collected on a monthly basis at Birchbank, Downtown Trail, Columbia Avenue, Columbia Gardens, Tadanac, Trail Hospital, Glenmerry, Oasis, Stoney Creek, Waneta and Warfield.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) gas is monitored at four locations throughout the valley - Birchbank, Butler Park, Columbia Gardens and Warfield. These stations operate continuously, with real-time data transmitted back to the operation&rsquo;s process control systems. If the SO<sub>2</sub> levels are beginning to climb (such as during a weather inversion), the plants are automatically notified so that actions can be taken to reduce SO<sub>2</sub> emissions. <br />In 2010, Teck added a real-time monitor for metal levels in ambient air. It identifies significant metal emission sources and&nbsp; alerts Teck staff to any issues that should be investigated and addressed.<br /><br />This information is collected and analyzed by Teck&rsquo;s environment staff and reported to the Ministry of Environment and the THEC.&nbsp; Regular monitoring helps identify significant emissions sources, track the effectiveness of emissions and dust control efforts, and track progress on air quality goals.<br /><br /><strong>How is dust controlled in the community?</strong><br />While most towns only clean their streets in the spring and fall, the City of Trail performs at least two extra street sweepings over the summer in order to control dust. The downtown core is swept and flushed weekly. The City pre-wets the roads prior to sweeping so that dust is not stirred up in the process. During the spring sweepings, it is difficult not to stir up dust but the sand applied in the winter does not contain lead, so lead levels on the street are relatively low.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dust control services include:</span><br />&bull; Summer street washing in the City of Trail<br />&bull; Dust suppressant applied to unpaved alleys each June in Trail<br />&bull; Collaboration between Teck and the City of Trail to provide grass cover on bare ground areas (i.e. Community Greening Program).&nbsp; For example, in 2012 Teck funded improvements to some bare areas under the large trees in Esplanade Park.<br /><br /><strong>How can I get more information?</strong><br />For more information on the Air Quality Program, please contact Richard Deane, Manager of Environment, Health &amp; Safety and Public Affairs, Teck Trail Operations at (250) 364-4118.<br /><br /><br /></p>
