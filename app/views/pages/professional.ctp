<h1>Are you a Health Care Professional?</h1>
<p>If you're looking for our program information, the first place to go is the <a title="thep resource library" href="/pages/resources/">Resource Library</a>. You may be particularly interested to see our most recent <a href="/upload/resources/13/fall11bloodlead_original.pdf">annual summary</a> of children&rsquo;s blood lead level (BLL) results. Note that Fact Sheets, FAQs, Newsletters and brochures are tailored for a public audience. If you are a health or environmental professional, you may be looking for more detailed information. Depending on what you&rsquo;re looking for, check out our <a href="/pages/reports/">reports</a> and the 2010 <a href="/upload/resources/11/thep_finalReport_april2011_final2_original.pdf">public consultation summary</a> (pdf). &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are interested in the results of two Trail area health studies that assessed risks for cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and chronic renal disease (CRD), here are the summary conclusions and links to the full studies:</p>
<p>Cancer Study, conducted in 1992 by the BC Cancer Agency. &nbsp;This examination of incidence and mortality data from the Trail School District does not suggest that environmental contamination from heavy metals is associated with an elevated risk of developing cancer. &nbsp;Click <a title="Cancer Study 1992" href="/upload/resources/66/Cancer_patterns_in_the_Trail_Area_1992_original.pdf">here</a> for the full study in the Reports section of our Resource Library.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IBD and CRD Study, conducted in 1994 by the Epidemiology section of the BC Ministry of Health. &nbsp;This study examined rates of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and chronic renal disease (CRD) hospitalizations and mortality in Trail compared with the wider region. &nbsp;The findings showed that Trail had lower rates of inflammatory bowel disease and similar rates of chronic renal disease compared to the Thompson-Okanagan-Kootenay Region. &nbsp;Click <a title="IBD and CRD Study 1994" href="/upload/resources/64/IBD_and_CRD_study_by_BC_CDC_1994_2_original.pdf">here</a> for the full study.</p>
