<h1>Community Consultation</h1>
<p>The Trail Area Health &amp; Environment Committee held broad community consultations in 2000 and 2010. The consultations involved outreach to residents and forums for residents to learn about issues, discuss proposed changes to program activities, and give input on the future direction of THE Program.<br /><br />The 2010 public consultation requested residents' input on new health and air quality goals as well as programs for Family Health, Home &amp; Garden, and Air Quality. The public strongly endorsed the blood lead and air quality goals as well as proposed programming. The consultation also revealed low public awareness of the program and, particularly, home renovation support. We&rsquo;ve taken this into account through increased program promotion, more contact with parents, a stronger connection with the Regional District of Kootenay Boundary building permits department, and more active links with community groups that support young families.<br /><br />To see the results of the 2010 public consultation, <a href="/upload/resources/11/thep_finalReport_april2011_final2_original.pdf">click here</a>.<br /><br /></p>
