<h1>Governance</h1>
<p>The Trail Area Health &amp; Environment Committee (THEC) oversees the program. THEC is a partnership between the local community, Teck, Interior Health and the BC Ministry of Environment. THEC is formally established as a Sub-Committee of the City of Trail.</p>
<p><strong>About the Committee (THEC)</strong><br />THEC is responsible for THE Program: the Committee reviews and refines the program regularly to incorporate the latest scientific information and evidence-based strategies. THEC has access to Teck's environmental monitoring data and receives regular summary reports. For more than 20 years, THEC has set and achieved goals for improved air quality and reduced lead exposure in children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 14px;">Community involvement has always been central to decision-making.</span><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span>THEC consulted the public in 2000 and 2010 to make sure that its goals were acceptable to the community and that its activities meet local needs.&nbsp;There are 5 community members-at-large on the Committee. Meetings are open to the public and the media. The minutes are available on this website. Every 6 months, the Committee publishes a newsletter that gets delivered to every household in Trail and Rivervale. Changes to programs are announced on the website and are typically reported in the local media.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Committee has operated since 1990. For the first 11 years, it was known as the Trail Community Lead Task Force. The Task Force was formed as a community- industry-government partnership to reduce children&rsquo;s blood lead levels.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 14px;">From the start, the Task Force established community priorities and adopted a community-driven approach. This approach has been recognized internationally as an effective collaborative model for protecting health and the environment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;Today, the Committee sees its mandate more broadly. &nbsp;While the main focus is preventing exposure to smelter metals in the community, the Committee is actively involved in partnerships and projects that promote children's healthy development. &nbsp;THEC is a founding member of the Family Action Network, a Greater Trail coalition dedicated to making the Trail area the best place to raise a family. &nbsp;In 2013, THEC started two new programs for expectant families and families with children under 3 years of age to help them keep their children healthy and their home and yard environments healthy and safe.</p>
