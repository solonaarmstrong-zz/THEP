<p><strong>What does the Family Health program do?</strong><br />The Family Health Program works with families in the Trail area to prevent children&rsquo;s exposure to lead.&nbsp; The program offers information and education for parents on how to prevent lead exposure, in-home visits for families with children under 12 months, children&rsquo;s blood lead testing, support for families where children have blood lead levels above the typical range, and referrals to the Home &amp; Garden Program. &nbsp;We also provide information on early learning programs and other local resources for families.<br /><br /><strong>Why is the focus on young children?</strong><br />&bull; y<span style="font-size: 14px;">oung children absorb lead up to 5 times more easily than older children or adults</span></p>
<p>&bull; small children are most likely to put dirty hands, food, and toys in their mouths and most lead gets into the body through the mouth</p>
<p>&bull; the early years of life are crucial for brain development, the years when children are also most at risk from the effects of lead exposure<strong><br /><br />What does this program offer to families?</strong></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: 14px;">Information on how to reduce children&rsquo;s lead exposure:</span></em><br /><span style="font-size: 14px;">Public health nurses offer education and information for parents and expectant families on how to reduce lead exposure. &nbsp;This includes how to keep the home and yard environment dust free and what's best for children's nutrition. &nbsp;Brochures and health tips are available on this website. &nbsp;For more detailed information, please <a href="/admin/contentedit/21">contact</a>&nbsp;Jeannine Stefani, Public Health Nurse at (250) 364-6223, jeannine.stefani@interiorhealth.ca, or drop by the Kiro Wellness Centre, Suite 2 &ndash; 1500 Columbia Avenue in Trail.</span><br /><br />We have a new service for families living in Trail or Rivervale with children under 12 months of age. &nbsp;Each family is offered a Healthy Family visit from our program's Public Health Nurse, Jeannine Stefani. &nbsp;If you're interested, Jeannine will visit you in your home to provide advice, support and answer your questions. &nbsp;Together, you can create create a plan for keeping your children healthy and preventing their exposure to lead. <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14px;">We make an effort to get our information out to all new families and pregnant women. We also offer education sessions to pregnancy outreach programs, pre-natal groups, early childhood programs and community events for families with young children.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14px;">&bull; Please contact us if you live in Trail or Rivervale and you&rsquo;re expecting or just had a baby.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14px;">&bull; Please contact us if you&rsquo;re new to the community and have young children or are expecting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14px;">&bull; Please tell your neighbour, friend, daughter, nephew, etc. about how to reach us if they have young children, or if they have questions.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14px;">&bull; If you&rsquo;re doing home renovations, please <a href="/admin/contentedit/21">contact </a>the Home Renovation Support Program at (250) 368-3256, by e-mail at programs@thep.ca, or drop by the Community Program Office at 1319 Bay Avenue.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p><strong>Collaborating with other groups that support young families</strong><br />We are dedicated to supporting children's health and development. &nbsp;Reducing lead exposure is our main focus but we know there are many factors that influence children's well-being. &nbsp;THEC is a founding member of the Family Action Network, collaborating with other groups in the Trail area to make this the best place to raise a family. &nbsp;For more information on the Family Action Network or other supports for children and families, please contact Christy Anderson, Regional Coordinator at coordinator@familyactionnetwork.ca or call (toll free) 1-855-368-3707.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Blood lead testing and follow-up support to keep blood lead levels down</strong><br />The program tests the blood lead levels in children aged 6-36 months living in Trail and Rivervale. &nbsp;Testing is available at parents&rsquo; request for children under 5 years anywhere in Greater Trail. &nbsp;Families new to the area or completing recent home renovations are encouraged to participate.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14px;">It is important to find out early if</span>&nbsp;your child&rsquo;s blood lead level is rising or is higher than most children's in the area. &nbsp;If it is, a public health nurse follows up with an in-home visit to help identify possible sources of lead exposure and make a plan with parents to reduce or eliminate exposure.&nbsp; This includes advice and information on nutrition, hand washing, damp mopping, vacuuming and damp dusting, ways to keep dirt from being tracked in the house, and checking for lead-based paint.&nbsp; Support may include referral to the Home &amp; Garden program for free soil testing and replacement (if needed), and advice about covering areas of bare soil in the yard.&nbsp; The nurse assists parents until the child&rsquo;s blood lead level has been reduced successfully.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>What have we achieved for children&rsquo;s health?</strong><br />The program has been working with Trail families since 1989.&nbsp; Blood lead levels in Trail pre-school children have dropped significantly, from an average of 13.5 to around 4.5 micrograms per declitre (&micro;g/dL) since annual blood lead testing started in 1989.&nbsp; The percentage of children with blood lead levels below 10 &micro;g/dL has gone from less than 20% in 1989 to about 90% today. This has held fairly steady for the past several years.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How do we set goals for children's health?</strong><br /><span style="font-size: 14px;">The Trail Area Health &amp; Environment Committee (THEC) stays abreast of government guidelines for blood lead levels. In early 2012, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) changed how it provides guidance on children's lead exposure. &nbsp;Up to now, the CDC and other international bodies referred to a "level of concern" of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 14px;">10 &micro;g/dL. &nbsp;Recent scientific studies of "populations of children" show that health, learning and behavioural effects of lead exposure can occur even at low levels. &nbsp;These health effects occur on a continuum with less exposure meaning lower health risks. &nbsp;At the blood lead levels we currently see in Trail, these effects are subtle and would not be noticeable in individual children. &nbsp;But we know there's more that can be done to make Trail the best possible environment for young families.</span><br /><br />Over the past 20 years, the North American &ldquo;background&rdquo; average blood lead for pre-school children has fallen from about 4 &micro;g/dL to less than 2&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 14px;">&micro;g/dL</span>.&nbsp; This background level is a reference to help us set our goals. THEC is pro-active, setting and achieving bold realistic goals that are acceptable to the community and government. &nbsp;&nbsp;In 2010, the Trail Area Health &amp; Environment Committee proposed tighter health goals to the public during a community consultation.&nbsp; Residents who replied to the survey showed strong support for these goals. &nbsp;As the goals have a target date of 2015, new goals will be proposed to the public after the Fall 2015 children's blood lead results are reported.<strong><br /><br />Children&rsquo;s blood lead goal:</strong><br /><em>&bull; to have an average blood lead level of 4 (&micro;g/dL) for children aged 6 to 36 months living in Trail and Rivervale by 2015</em><br /><br />We know it will be a challenge to reach this goal by 2015.&nbsp; Continuing to reduce smelter emissions is the most important factor (for more information, see the Air Quality Fact Sheet).<br /><br /><strong>Family health is a community effort</strong><br />Interior Health provides education, testing and support to families. Teck and the City of Trail work to improve air quality. The Community Program Office offers home renovation support and soil testing and remediation.&nbsp; Parents can help by getting their children tested, making needed changes to their home and garden environments, and optimizing children's nutrition to reduce lead exposure and absorption.</p>
<p>Please know that you, and others like you, help make this program a success! <strong><br /><br />Goal for participation in blood lead testing:</strong><br />&bull; <em>At least 75% of children in Trail &amp; Rivervale will have their blood lead levels tested each year, from the age of 6 to 36 months</em><br /><br />To reach our blood lead goal, we need to keep testing as many children aged 6 to 36 months as possible.&nbsp; We want to make sure that our exposure prevention efforts are working. &nbsp;The proof is in the testing. &nbsp;Let's keep reducing lead exposure for all Trail area children. <br /><br /><strong>What are 10 Top Tips for Family Health?</strong><br />Most Trail area families know what they need to do to keep their children safe from lead exposure. Are all of these on your list?<br />1. Make sure your children wash their hands and wash your hands often: always wash hands before eating or touching food (even if you've only been indoors) and when coming in from outside. <br />2. Keep your home clean with frequent vacuuming, wet-mopping and damp-dusting. Avoid sweeping.<br />3. Keep floors super clean if you have a baby crawling. For a younger baby, put a blanket on the floor. Wash toys, soothers, and bottle nipples often, especially when children are teething.<br />4. Keep children and pregnant women away from home renovations. Contact the Home Renovation Support Program. Clean up well when renovations are finished.<br />5. Leave outside shoes at the door. Place a dust mat at your door.<br />6. Eat regular healthy, balanced meals with lots of calcium, iron and vitamin C. Avoid high fat foods or having an empty stomach, as lead is absorbed more easily.<br />7. Wash garden veggies and fruit before eating them. Peel root veggies and wash leafy greens really well.<br />8. Keep outdoor play areas clean. Sandboxes need clean sand and should be covered when not in use. Regularly hose driveways, childrens toys, play equipment, decks and paved areas. Healthy grass is a great play area.<br />9. Brush and wash pets often and always outdoors. Keep them off children&rsquo;s beds.<br />10. Cover up areas of bare soil in your yard, and keep grass healthy. Contact the Yard and Garden Soils Program.<br /><strong><br />How can I get more information?</strong><br />For information on the Family Health Program, <a href="/admin/contentedit/21">contact</a> Jeannine Stefani, Interior Health, at (250) 364-6223. <br /><br />To see where the Family Health Program is offered, please see the Family Health Program map on our <a title="area maps" href="/pages/maps/">maps page</a>.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
