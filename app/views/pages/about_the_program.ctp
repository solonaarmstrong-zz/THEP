<h1>About THE Program</h1>
<p>The Trail Area Health &amp; Environment Program is a comprehensive, community-led program with 5 main areas of activity: Family Health, Home &amp; Garden, Air Quality, Parks and Wildlands, and Property Development. Our mission is to promote people&rsquo;s health and environment, with a focus on preventing children&rsquo;s exposure to lead. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a title="Air Quality Fact sheet" href="/pages/airquality">Air Quality Program</a> reduces smelter emissions and makes the largest contribution to achieving health and environment goals. All our activities work together to get the best results &ndash; lower exposure, lower health risks, and a healthier environment.</p>

THEC is a partnership between the local community, Teck, the Ministry of Environment, and Interior Health. Over the past 20 years of successful collaboration, children&rsquo;s blood levels in Trail have reduced significantly and air quality has greatly improved. THEC&rsquo;s community-led partnership has been recognized internationally as an effective collaborative model for safeguarding health and the environment.&nbsp; In 2011 the program received a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGBIt2zZydY">Premier&rsquo;s Innovation and Excellence Award for Partnership</a>.<br /><br /></p>
