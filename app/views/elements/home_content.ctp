<h1>Welcome to THE Program</h1>
<p>The Trail Area Health &amp; Environment Committee welcomes you to our community-led program promoting healthy living and the environment in the Trail BC area.&nbsp; We believe "It Starts With the Kids" and&nbsp;as such,&nbsp;we work with families and community members&nbsp;and offer up-to-date,&nbsp;helpful information.&nbsp; We also provide&nbsp;supports for&nbsp;family and environmental health with a focus on promoting children's healthy development and preventing lead exposure.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />With over 20 years experience, we&rsquo;ve met all our goals for <a title="Air Quality Program Fact Sheet" href="/pages/airquality">air quality</a> and reduced lead exposure in children. Our collaborative approach has been recognized with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGBIt2zZydY" target="_blank">BC Premier&rsquo;s Award</a>.&nbsp;</p>
